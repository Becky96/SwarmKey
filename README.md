# SwarmKey

This project is for the submission of the final year project for Bsc Creative Computing at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

The required addons are attached in this repository: ofxMaxim, ofxDatGui, and ofxMidi. The addons need to be placed in the openFrameworks addons directory in order to compile the program. 
An external digital audio workstation or MIDI-receiving device needs to be configured to listen on the port 'Swarm' for channels 1 and 2.
